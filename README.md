# Physiological Data
Combines title sheets with data sheets, transposes and collates all files in folder. Before running, make sure that the only files in the current folder are the excel files containing the physiological data, and the file containing the labels for the data.

## Setup
Running this software requires python, pip, pandas, and xlrd.

### Python
If you don't have python installed, you can download it from https://www.python.org/

### pip
On a new install of python, it should have pip installed, but if not, open a command prompt and type: sudo apt-get pip

### pandas
Pandas is a data science library used to handle excel documents. To install this, open a command prompt and type: pip install pandas

### xlrd
xlrd is software needed by pandas to load excel files. I don't know if it comes included, but I had to install it on my own. To install this, open a command prompt and type: pip install xlrd
